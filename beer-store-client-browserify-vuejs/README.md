# beer-store-client-browserify-vuejs

This sample application illustrates how to build the beer store using browserify and vuejs.

We also use [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), but the fetch api would do the job.

## How do i run this?

Open a terminal in this folder and:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

I'll assume that you have a modern nodejs/npm setup in place.
