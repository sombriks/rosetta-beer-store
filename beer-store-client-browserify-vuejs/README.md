# beer-store-client-browserify-vuejs

This sample application illustrates how to build the beer store using 
browserify and vuejs.

We use [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), but the 
[fetch api](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) 
would do the job.

We also use [budo](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo) as our dev server so we 
can code and test faster. Budo uses [browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify) 
to bundle sources into a final js archive.

## How to run this

Open a terminal in this folder and:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

I'll assume that you have a modern nodejs/npm setup in place.
