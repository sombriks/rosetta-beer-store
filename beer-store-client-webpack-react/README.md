# beer-store-client-webpack-react

This sample application illustrates how to build the beer store using
webpack and react.

We use [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), but the
[fetch api](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
would do the job.

We also use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#entry) to define an entry
point, how modules shall be loaded, where to output the final bundle and to set
up a development server with hot module replacement capabilities.

## How to run this

Open a terminal in this folder and:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

I'll assume that you have a modern nodejs/npm setup in place.
