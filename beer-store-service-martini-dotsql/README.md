This exercise shows how the beerservice can be implemented using the go ecosystem 

## How do i run this?

Open a terminal on the folder coltaining this readme and 

```bash
make dev

After a few errors pop out, use the *go get -v * thing to install every 
missing dependency

Make sure you have the go installed correctly on your system and provide 
reasonable values for **GOROOT** and **GOPATH** variables.
