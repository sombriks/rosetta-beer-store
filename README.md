# rosetta-beer-store

The very same beer store implemented in various stacks. Also, fontends and backends are interchangeable

## Why?

To compare stacks, analyze solutions, maybe give you a glimpse on what each approach can do.

Also because it's fun.

## How does it work?

Each project will have one README.md explaining how to fire the engines.

You will need at least one service and one client running in order to see a complete work.

We'll have clients and services. 

Services must provide the very same REST API so their clients shall connect on it in a transparent way.

Therefore all services must use port 3000. 

You shall run just one service at time.

The clients have not such limitation. 

However you must correctly point them to the service address.

This is not a simple language comparison, but tooling as well. 

Is there more than one way to set up a java service project? Let's have it!

More than one way to set up a javascript client project! Let's go!
