# beer-store-client-cdn-angular1x

This sample repo shows how to build the beer store client using 
[the old angular](https://angularjs.org/) and cdn's instead of a bundler.

There is no reloader, updater, nothing. We're far from that nowadays, yet it's
still a valid sample.

Just open the index.html with your browser and see the beer store.
