# beer-store-client-cdn-angular1x

This sample repo shows how to build the beer store client using 
[the old angular](https://angularjs.org/) and cdn's instead of a bundler.

We're using budo there, but there is no bundle step. We just use it to serve 
the content in a faster and simpler way.

## How do i run this?

Open a terminal in this folder and:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
